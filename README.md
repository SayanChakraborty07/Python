DESCRIPTION:

This project is a menu-driven scientific calculator built using Python. It allows users to perform a variety of basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) as well as scientific calculations such as exponentiation, trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent), and angle conversions between degrees and radians. 
The program continuously prompts users to perform calculations until they choose to exit. It uses Pythonâ€™s built-in math library to handle advanced mathematical operations with accuracy. The user interface is simple and text-based, making it easy to interact with.

FEATURES:

Basic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

Scientific Functions: Exponentiation, sine, cosine, tangent.

Angle Conversion: Degrees to radians and radians to degrees.

User Interaction: Menu-driven design for smooth navigation.

Loop Structure: Users can perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

USE CASES:
Quick mathematical calculations.

Educational purposes for learning Python basics.

Simple scientific calculations without using a physical calculator.
